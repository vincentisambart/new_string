This is what should become the MacRuby String and Encoding classes.

It's still in a very early state so nearly nothing works.

It's available under the same licence as MacRuby.

unicode/*.h are the headers for the version of ICU included in Mac OS X 10.5
(ICU 3.6).

objc.h and bs.h are copied directly from MacRuby.

To build it: macruby extconf.rb && make

The classes defined by this extension are MRString and MREncoding.
